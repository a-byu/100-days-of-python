This is my first README

Day 01 of learning python

I am working on homework provided by indently's 25_days_challenge_project, big thanks to him.

the job is to make a miles to kilometers converter and vice versa, here the desc:

HOMEWORK:

Your homework is to create a miles-to-kilometers converter in Python!

The script should:

- Allow the user to convert from kilometers to miles and vice versa.

- Display the formatted result in the console using f-strings.

###

at first attempt, i pushed the code without running it first, then i got an error message hahaha
it says something cannot float something

so i changed the previously input() to float (input())

playing with variable and f'strings, its fun
