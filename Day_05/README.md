This should be the 6th day, but yesterday i got a fever and couldn't think straight.

i just tidying the cleanliness of the previous code to keep the contribution mark on check (its not fair)

and today is the same too, i am working on the first problem out of three but still not found the solution.

honestly i-my mind exactly-preoccupied with other things that need to be solved asap or i wouldn't have any focus left to be spent on other things.

so today, i will just upload the unsolved version

=================================================

Its the second day i am working with the first problem.

now i am able to solve the empty and zero input with different loop. I know it can be done within a single loop, i will look into it with more to add, like negative input.

But the problem is, in the second loop which is correcting for '0', if i enter '', it will crash.

So yeah, anyway it must be done in one loop.
