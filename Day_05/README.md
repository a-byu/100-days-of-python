This should be the 6th day, but yesterday i got a fever and couldn't think straight.

i just tidying the cleanliness of the previous code to keep the contribution mark on check (its not fair)

and today is the same too, i am working on the first problem out of three but still not found the solution.

honestly i-my mind exactly-preoccupied with other things that need to be solved asap or i wouldn't have any focus left to be spent on other things.

so today, i will just upload the unsolved version
