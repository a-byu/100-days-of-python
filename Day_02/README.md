Homework:

1. Add projections for how much tax you'd pay if you doubled and tripled your income.

This day homework is to project the tax if the income is doubled or tripled, so i just added some variable that will do enough to double the income and using the previous input of tax rate.

but i know that is not how tax works, if the income increases past certain point, the tax rate will change accordingly

i found the tax rates as i searched online, i will work on it later (don't know yet what to do about it, hehe).

for now, here is the first version

this night,
i upgraded the program with the help of AI, not plain code, but guide to the solution
i feel so dumb when i spent 2 hours for trying my solution, yet they never work

in the end, i used AI to find it, not that i proud of it, but i learned so much thanks to trial and error.
now the second version is done, i am planning to use loop for the next upgrade, on my own.
