Homework:

1. Add projections for how much tax you'd pay if you doubled and tripled your income.

This day homework is to project the tax if the income is doubled or tripled, so i just added some variable that will do enough to double the income and using the previous input of tax rate.

but i know that is not how tax works, if the income increases, the tax rate will change accordingly, same way if it decreases, at least i know that much (cmiiw)

i found the tax rates as i searched online, i will work on it later (don't know yet what to do about it, hehe).

for now, here is the first version
