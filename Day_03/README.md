Its Day 03

today's homework is to write a story and asking user for inputs that may alter the story

the challanging part is to write the story itself, why don't use AI and do the job quick?

yes, that will do

yet i see this chance as a way to not only improve my logic on coding, i could hone myself in a creative aspect-and english too!
